Generate Networking App
=====================

The app is the companion to the article "Building Mobile Apps with Ionic", due to be released in Net Magazine. This framework is designed to help build fast scalable apps with a mixture of Cordova, Angular JS and Ionic's own UI framework.

## Installing Ionic

Before you can run the code, you need to have Ionic installed. More information on this can be found on [Ionic's Getting Started page](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started).

## Getting this up and running

This example has been built for iOS, so we assume you are on a Mac. Once you have cloned the project, change your directory in terminal so you are within the route folder. Then run

```bash
$ ionic emulate ios
```

This should bring up the iOS simulator with the working project.
